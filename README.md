# Hololens Experimenting

A place where I experiment with Hololens Development

## About

This project repo is a playground where I experiment with developing apps for the Hololens 2.  If you visit this repo, keep a couple of things in mind:
1. I am still fairly unfamiliar with managing project repos in GitHub.  I have primarily (if not, exclusively) used Azure DevOps (formerly Team Services).  Please forgive me while I get familiar with the tools.
2. I am most familiar with building traditional apps (desktop and web), and, even though I work as an application developer, it is in an organization where I am the primary develoepr and have one junior developer that had no prior software development experience.  With that in mind, I may take certain approaches that are unconventional/unorthodox because I do not have the experience of working with larger teams.

I guess one other thing to keep in mind is: while I have dabbled with Unity in the past, and followed many tutorials, I still have not created a full project using it.  It is another toolset that I am mostly unfamiliar with its capabilities, methodologies, and overall use.

Regardless, I hope to learn a lot about GitHub, developing in Unity, and my ultimate goal is to learn how to develop with the aim of deploying to multiple platforms, including XR.

## Progress So Far

I will use this section to list things that I have done with regards to this repo.  Hopefully it will help me track things I have tried, how they turned out, and what I have learned from them.

### Entry 2019-11-16.1:

Created GitHub project page for a space to experiment with Hololen Development.  While typing this, I realized that this really should be for XR, but I plan on targetting the Hololens 2 specifically, so hopefully it was a good choice to name the project this.

### Entry: 2019-11-16.2:

Came up with a format for entering information into this section.  Weird that I am logging an entry about logging entries, but it is helping me feel a bit more loose with this process.  Hopefully it will keep me feeling relaxed while experimenting in a public space.
