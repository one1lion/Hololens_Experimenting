# Hololens Experimenting

A place where I experiment with Hololens Development

## About

This project repo is a playground where I experiment with developing apps for the Hololens 2.  If you visit this repo, keep a couple of things in mind:
1. I am still fairly unfamiliar with managing project repos in GitHub.  I have primarily (if not, exclusively) used Azure DevOps (formerly Team Services).  Please forgive me while I get familiar with the tools.
2. I am most familiar with building traditional apps (desktop and web), and, even though I work as an application developer, it is in an organization where I am the primary develoepr and have one junior developer that had no prior software development experience.  With that in mind, I may take certain approaches that are unconventional/unorthodox because I do not have the experience of working with larger teams.

I guess one other thing to keep in mind is: while I have dabbled with Unity in the past, and followed many tutorials, I still have not created a full project using it.  It is another toolset that I am mostly unfamiliar with its capabilities, methodologies, and overall use.

Regardless, I hope to learn a lot about GitHub, developing in Unity, and my ultimate goal is to learn how to develop with the aim of deploying to multiple platforms, including XR.
